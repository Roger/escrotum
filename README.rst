      SPECIAL STRINGS
      filename parameters can take format specifiers
      that are expanded by escrotum when encountered.
      There are two types of format specifier. Characters preceded by a '%'
      are interpretted by strftime(2). See man strftime for examples.
      These options may be used to refer to the current date and time.
      The second kind are internal to escrotum  and are prefixed by '$'
      The following specifiers are recognised:
            $w image width
            $h image height
            $u random uuid
      Example:
            escrotum '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h_scrotum.png'
            Creates a file called something like 2013-06-17-082335_263x738_escrotum.png
